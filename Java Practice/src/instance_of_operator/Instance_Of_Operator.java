	//The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).
	//The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type.
	//It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.
